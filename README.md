## Usage

### HTML Image

Using the `<img />` element directly in your HTML file.

```
<img src="path/to/icon.svg" alt="icon title" />
```

### Inline HTML

You can paste the content of the icon file directly into your HTML code to display it on the page using the `<svg> </svg>` tag.

```
<body>
 // Add your SVG code here
</body>
```

### CSS

Instead of using an HTML `<img />` element, you can use CSS instead and apply it as a background to any other element.

```
body {
  background-image: url(path/to/icon.svg);
}
```

### SVG as an object

You can also use the `<object>` tag to add the SVG to your page

```
<object data="path/to/icon.svg" width="24" height="24"> </object>
```

### Using <iframe>

Keep in mind that using iframe is not recommended, because its hard to maintain

```
<iframe src="path/to/icon.svg"> </iframe>
```

### SVG as embed

Most of the modern browsers have deprecated plugins, so this is not recommended.

```
<embed src="path/to/icon.svg" />
```

### Figma

HackerNoonâ€™s Pixel Icon Library is available as a [Figma Community File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1278952394341234192/Pixel-Icon-Library-%7C-120%2B-Pixelated-Icons-By-HackerNoon). To use the components, log in to your Figma account and duplicate the file to your drafts.
